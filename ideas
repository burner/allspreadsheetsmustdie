There are all these languages we like to hate
Rust, C++, go, JS, D you name it.
But there is one we all can learn to hate, and it is the one that rules the
world.
It is spreedsheets.
And I know what you are thinking, using spreedsheets is not programming.
It is Turing complete, after all.
So what more do you need.
Lets look at some of its awesome features.
* Silent out of bounds errors
* Perfect fit for version control systems
* Consist APIs (multi similar named functions)
* Perfect mix between code and data
* nice VBA integration
* functional programming features
* imperative programming features

And it runs the world

So if we, as the D community, want to rule the world, we shouldn't aim to
supersede C++ we should to supersede Excel.

Let me forshadow your feeling.
You think spreedsheets are not ruling the world.
But if you think about it a little you will feel this.
MEME.

Spreadsheets must die.

CSV + D example, name colums A B C D E F
We are done now, lets go home.
